# Mixture-of-Gaussians-Clustering-and-Classification
This repository explores the Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) model for clustering and classification tasks. It includes implementations of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, analysis of cluster evolution, phoneme classification using maximum likelihood, and handling singular covariance matrix issues through regularization techniques.
